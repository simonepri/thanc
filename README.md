# ‚≠ê  thanc
thanc: a smarty way to thank the authors of NPM packages by starring their repos on Github :heart:

With thanc you'll thank every dependency and sub-dependency (**literally the whole dependencies tree**) of a given project provided with a `package.json` (or better a `package-lock.json`) manifest.
So yes, it works also with `yarn` üò∫

This is what thanc looks like:

![start](https://github.com/wilk/thanc/raw/master/start.png "start")

and then, after too many repos:

![end](https://github.com/wilk/thanc/raw/master/end.png "end")

Inspired by:

- https://github.com/zwilias/elm-thanks
- https://github.com/symfony/thanks

## ü§î  Why thanc and not just thank?!?
Basically, because the thank (and also thanks) package already exists on NPM registry.

Thanc (or thancian) is the ancient english word to say thank, so that's why :bowtie:

## üîí  Authentication Types Supported
thanc supports two types of authentication:

- **Basic**: it requires your Github username and password
- **Token**: it requires one of your Github user token (just **[create a new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)** here with `public_repo` permission)

## üõ†  Installation
thanc can be installed locally or globally.
 
### Install locally
```bash
$ npm i -D thanc
```

Then, under the scripts section of your `package.json`:
```bash
"thanc": "thanc ."
```

And then:
```bash
$ npm run thanc
```

### Install globally
```bash
$ npm i -g thanc
```

Then:
```bash
$ thanc
```

## ‚öô  Usage
Thanking current folder:

```bash
$ thanc
```

Thanking a specific folder:

```bash
$ thanc myProject
```

Thanking the `thanc` project:

```bash
$ thanc --me
```

Thanking without seeing the repos list but a progress bar instead:

```bash
$ thanc --quite .
```

### Explicit credentials

**Basic Auth**
```bash
$ thanc -u <your_github_username> -p <your_github_password> .
```

**User Token**

Explicit:
```bash
$ thanc -t <your_github_token> .
```

Via `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var:
```bash
$ export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_github_token>; thanc .
```

### Help
thanc has several options you can check through `--help`:

```bash
$ thanc --help

  Usage: thanc [options] <project_path>


  Options:

    -V, --version              output the version number
    --me                       thank thanc package and all of its dependencies
    -u, --username <username>  your Github username
    -p, --password <password>  your Github password
    -t, --token <password>     your Github token
    -q, --quite                Show only the progress bar instead of the repos list
    -h, --help                 output usage information
```

## ‚úã  Limitations
Github APIs have some limitations:

1. [rate limiting](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting): each user can perform **5000 requests per hour**, so if you're using thanc intensively, you may encounter the rate limit error. Don't panic, take a coffee with a friend, and then start back starring repos :muscle:
2. [abuse rate limit](https://developer.github.com/v3/#abuse-rate-limits): Github prevents making lots of rapidly requests for a single user (they want to guarantee the quality of service) so thanc stars chunks of **35 repos at a time.**

## üí•  Known Issues
Some repos cannot be starred, due to:

- missing repository property on package.json manifest
- missing package on NPM registry (thanc relies on that)
- missing repository on Github (thanc uses NPM registry info)

Sometimes, some repos can be starred twice because they might have a very similar url but different, pointing to the same github repo
